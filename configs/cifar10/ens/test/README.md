Note this folder contains relevant code to test old model implementation, the one used in the paper, and the one used in this repository.


There are slight numerical differences with this new framework due to the parameters being injected and scaled in batched modules. You can expect results to be similar, but use this ResNet18 ensemble module to test against any methods you implement.
